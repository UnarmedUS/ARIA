# Privacy Policy for A.R.I.A

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how A.R.I.A (“the Bot”) handles information during use.

## 1. Data the Bot Receives
The Bot only accesses the following when interacting in Discord:
- Messages sent directly to it (via slash commands or mentions)
- Basic Discord user or server context provided automatically by the platform

## 2. Data Storage
A.R.I.A does **not**:
- Log or save messages long-term
- Store personal data outside Discord
- Create user profiles
- Share data with any external parties

All processing happens in real time solely to generate a response.

## 3. Third Parties
The Bot runs only through Discord’s platform. No external APIs or services store your information unless expressly added later.

## 4. Security
Because the Bot does not store or transmit data outside Discord, no additional retention or encryption systems are required.

## 5. Contact and Ownership
The Bot is privately managed by its sole owner. If you have concerns or wish to stop using the Bot, discontinue interaction at any time.

## 6. Updates
This Privacy Policy may be revised if features change. Continued use implies acceptance of updates.

If you do not agree with the policy, do not use the Bot.
